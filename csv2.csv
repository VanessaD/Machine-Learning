While I definitely don't intend on making this kind of video a regular presence on the channel, in this very special instance I felt so strongly about the issue that I wanted to say something on a personal note. Thanks for all your support and for checking out this very special video from me, and as always, thanks for watching!\n\nYou've no doubt heard the story over the last week. Viner turned social media star Logan Paul uploaded an exploitative and disrespectful video. A LOT has already been said about that. Instead, I'm here today to comment on YouTube's response. A week after the video, YouTube released an open letter saying that it will take steps to address the situation, but as we all know, they sometimes OVERCORRECT in times like this. So before YouTube takes any actions that might potentially harm the creators and viewers on this platform, I have a few words that I’d like to share.\n\n\nFor More about YouTube & Its Online Community:\n\nThe Rise of Logan Paul and Jake Paul ►►  https://goo.gl/v39Peo\nHow Minecraft BROKE YouTube ►► https://goo.gl/odWbMv\nWhy FAKE NEWS Rules Social Media ►► https://goo.gl/LZDPeh\nEmoji Movie Would Be ILLEGAL On YouTube ► https://goo.gl/Yo7Cj9","['Logan paul', 'jake paul', 'logan paul vlog', 'logan paul apology', 'team 10', 'team ten', 'paul brothers', 'logan paul controversy', 'youtube controversy', 'logan paul loophole', 'logan paul loop hole', 'matpat', 'youtube open letter', 'matpat open letter', 'game theorists', 'game theory', 'pewdiepie controversy', 'youtube', 'logan paul japan', 'phil defranco', 'h3h3', 'h3h3 logan paul', 'h3h3 jake paul', 'phil defranco logan paul']",The Game Theorists,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qCp4VjZLBk0/default.jpg,3.200000047683716,"[('/Arts & Entertainment', 0.5099999904632568)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5099999904632568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

No, The Emoji Movie is bad because it's one huge commercial. A commercial that is targeting children while blatantly breaking rules established by the FTC and FCC for disclosing branded advertising.

Through our analysis of the game, its gameplay and beta builds, we hope to show some interesting facts from the making of South Park: The Fractured But Whole and have its history explained.\n\nFollow DYKG on:\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2oOavs2\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2oO4jjA\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2nIrFp9\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/NpYDbD\n\nVoiced by Caddy\nVideo Editing by Luis Illingworth @HeyRaguio\nResearch/Writing by Kellen McIntyre\n\nSources/Further Reading:\nhttp://www.gamertagradio.com/2017/09/episode-699-south-park-fractured-whole-interview/ \nhttps://kotaku.com/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-got-its-title-becau-1784259164\nhttps://youtu.be/v9oqGxmuKcQ \nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-09-07-south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-difficulty-slider-changes-the-colour-of-your-skin \nhttp://ign.com/articles/2017/10/12/how-south-park-made-its-brand-of-production-hell-work-for-the-fractured-but-whole \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/russespinoza/2017/10/17/trey-parker-risked-it-all-for-the-new-south-park-video-game-the-fractured-but-whole/#5bb4d5cc17fd \nhttps://youtu.be/QQAR5iRB8Lg \nhttps://youtu.be/6QwuTGmcABc \nhttps://tcrf.net/South_Park:_The_Fractured_But_Whole","['south park', 'south park fractured but whole', 'caddicarus', 'south park the fractured but whole', 'fractured but whole', 'the fractured but whole', 'dykgaming', 'didyouknowgaming', 'gaming', 'did you know gaming', 'trey parker', 'matt stone', 'dykg', 'caddy', 'south park game', 'south park videogame', 'new south park', 'south park episodes', 'southpark', 'gameplay', 'easter egg', 'easter eggs', 'analysis', 'beta', 'stick of truth', 'south park the stick of truth', 'south park stick of truth', 'the stick of truth']",DidYouKnowGaming?,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2QU89Dj-f4/default.jpg,1.0,"[('/Arts & Entertainment/Online Media', 0.6200000047683716), ('/Games/Computer & Video Games/Casual Games', 0.5199999809265137)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5199999809265137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5199999809265137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6200000047683716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6200000047683716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5199999809265137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Over the past few years, Howard has moved more and more into the industry spotlight thanks to games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4. However, Howard is a veteran of Bethesda Softworks, and has been a guiding force at the company for nearly two decades, with his first real job at the company being on movie games like Terminator. Howard's biggest impact has been on The Elder Scrolls series, and profoundly influenced Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim.

bU_8Ht2fFc4,Announcement: Extra Credits Starts Twitch Streaming on December 12,"We're coming back to Twitch in a big way! Hang out with us: http://www.twitch.tv/extracredits\nWe're going to start streaming on Twitch beginning December 12! New episodes of our shows (especially ESF!) will have a Twitch debut with live discussion, and we'll have James Portnow, Dan Jones, and Will Overgard leading the Extra Stream Crew six days a week!\n___________\n\nFrequently Asked Questions!\n\nQ: Where can I follow/subscribe to your Twitch channel?\nA: Right here: https://www.twitch.tv/extracredits/\n\nQ: If episodes debut on Twitch, will you still air them on YouTube?\nA: Of course! There will be a short delay (~30 minutes) between their debut on Twitch and their arrival on YouTube, just to give the live discussion on Twitch a bit of time to pick through the content. But YouTube remains our primary home, and if this is where you like to watch our videos, you don't need to change anything - they'll still be here!\n\nQ: Who narrated this video?\nA: That would be Will Overgard, international man of mystery and our newest team member. Will has also done a number of Let's Plays with us, and you can see more of him (and his enthusiastic British accent) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh72ohu6YDM&list=PLvFQJa1XAXzxhNdczzGXZDpF1YQ0cFjxb\n\nQ: How often will you be streaming?\nA: We'll be streaming pretty much every weekday, plus a bonus stream or two on Saturdays! In other words: quite a lot. Right now, to celebrate the relaunch of our Twitch channel, we're streaming as much as 8-10 hours a day. Future schedules will be posted on our Twitch channel!\n\nQ: Does this mean Book Club is coming back?\nA: AW. HECK. YISS. James will be reading snippets from the books and stories featured on Extra Sci Fi while David live-draws sketches inspired by the subject. To make this event possible, we've moved the launch time of Extra Sci Fi back from our usual 10am PST to 5pm PST, and we hope you'll join us there!\n___________\n\n♪ Music: ""Play With Me"" by DDRKirby(ISQ)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaI-yWanTo","['extra credits', 'extra history', 'extra sci fi', 'esf', 'ec', 'eh', 'extra scifi', 'livestream', 'broadcast', 'twitch', 'twitch channel', 'extra credits channel', 'announcement', 'introducing', 'will overgard', 'james portnow', 'david hueso', 'dan jones', 'stream', 'live content', 'live broadcast', 'discussion', 'rebroadcast', 'stream schedule', 'games you might not have tried', 'tea and james', 'dan jones adventures', 'tea and james and games', 'extra stream crew']",Extra Credits,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bU_8Ht2fFc4/default.jpg,4.0,"[('/Arts & Entertainment/TV & Video/Online Video', 0.7400000095367432), ('/Arts & Entertainment/Online Media', 0.7099999785423279), ('/Games/Computer & Video Games', 0.5199999809265137)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5199999809265137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5199999809265137,0.0,0.7400000095367432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7099999785423279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7400000095367432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7099999785423279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

A8Tiba3h9Fw,Don Bradman's Duck - Numberphile,"One of the most famous stories from the sort of cricket involves numbers, averages, and a duck.\nMore links & stuff in full description below ↓↓↓\n\nArchive footage courtesy of AP Archive:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/aparchive\n\n* Batting average list shown was current in December 2017. It includes one still active player (Australian Steve Smith) whose average will change. It is a list that uses a threshold of 20 matches minimum. Different lists use different minimums for matches, innings, or runs scored to weed out freakish cases.\n\n** Comparing athletes, especially across sports, is notoriously difficult and more of a conversation starter than exact science. An interesting article here: https://www.statslife.org.uk/sports/1989-did-don-bradman-s-cricketing-genius-make-him-a-statistical-outlier\n\n*** A lower ""not out"" score in Bradman's next innings would also have made a 100+ average possible, but that's a very unlikely scenario in the ""first innings"" of a match. I did not want the video getting bogged down by intricacies and unlikely scenarios. In case you are curious, here is the scorecard for the next match Australia played... http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Matches/MatchScorecard.asp?MatchCode=0318\n\nNumberphile is supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI): http://bit.ly/MSRINumberphile\n\nWe are also supported by Science Sandbox, a Simons Foundation initiative dedicated to engaging everyone with the process of science.\n\nNUMBERPHILE\nWebsite: http://www.numberphile.com/\nNumberphile on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/numberphile\nNumberphile tweets: https://twitter.com/numberphile\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Numberphile_Sub\n\nVideos by Brady Haran\n\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/numberphile\n\nBrady's videos subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/BradyHaran/\n\nBrady's latest videos across all channels: http://www.bradyharanblog.com/\n\nSign up for (occasional) emails: http://eepurl.com/YdjL9","['numberphile', 'donald bradman', 'batting average']",Numberphile,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8Tiba3h9Fw/default.jpg,1.7999999523162842,"[('/Sports/Team Sports/Cricket', 0.8600000143051147), ('/News/Sports News', 0.8399999737739563), ('/Sports/Team Sports/Baseball', 0.6800000071525574)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6800000071525574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6800000071525574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8600000143051147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8399999737739563,0.0,0.6800000071525574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8399999737739563,0.0,0.0

Some people suggest they may be a better fit on Brady's dedicated physics channel (called Sixty Symbols).\n\nIn response, the reasons they are on Numberphile are:\n\n1) Tadashi, while certainly a modern polymath, is based in a mathematics department.\n2) This sub series (with its animation and extra production work) has been supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, a Numberphile collaborator.\n3) Some of the previous and future Tadashi videos are more math-oriented than physics - and it just makes sense to put them on one channel rather than dividing the series between two channels on an ad hoc basis.\n\nIn a multi-disciplinary world, it is challenging to run YouTube channels which people come to associate with just one discipline.\n\nThat said, feel free to go over and watch hundreds of physics videos on Sixty Symbols --- https://www.youtube.com/sixtysymbols","['numberphile', 'kamifusen', 'paper balloon']",Numberphile,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/un-pTKfC1dQ/default.jpg,0.5,"[('/Arts & Entertainment', 0.6299999952316284), ('/Science', 0.5699999928474426)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5699999928474426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6299999952316284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

What's the point when nobody cares?\nIt uses Splash in battle. Nothing happens.\nJumping and splashing every single day.\nUntil Pidgeotto… carries it away.\n\nThe jumping Pokémon, that's you, Magikarp.\nAlthough your moves are pointless, still you've won my heart.\nOh, splashing Pokémon, my love for you is strong.\nHonestly, it's magical, you've survived this long.\n\nWherever you go fishing, it's the first you'll catch.\nEven with an Old Rod, you'll soon have quite a batch.\n\nCast off in a river, or a puddle, or the sea.\nAnywhere your hook is, Magikarp will be.\nThe slightest current will carry it away.\nAnyplace the river bends… that's where they all stay.\n\nA nibble on the line… that's you, Magikarp.\nRight back in you go, because you've won my heart.\nThought I caught a bite… but it's Magikarp.\nI could never eat you… because you've won my heart.\n\nIts Shiny form sparkles golden in the light.\nBut don't be deceived. It's still Magikarp inside.\n\nEvolving into Gyarados makes it super strong.\nWaiting to reach that level takes way too long.\nDid you just buy one at the store yesterday?\nSorry, there's no refunds. Please go away.\n\nThe pity Pokémon, that's you, Magikarp.\nAlthough they think you're worthless… still you've won my heart.\nThe pity Pokémon, Magikarp, it's true.\nAt least your lowly ranking… means nothing to you.\n\nBeloved Pokémon, that's you, Magikarp.\nSomehow you've turned weakness into a kind of art.\nYou're my Pokémon, Magikarp, my dream…\nSix matching Magikarp, that'll be my team.\n\nBeloved Pokémon, that's you, Magikarp.\nMagical and special, of course you've won my heart.\nThe greatest Pokémon, Magikarp, it's true.\nAnd that's why I've written this love song just for you!","['violin', 'guitar', 'vgm', 'instrumental', 'covers', 'remix', 'diwa de leon', 'string player gamer', 'mini mario orchestra', 'video game orchestra', 'orchestral video game covers', 'Pok\xc3\xa9mon', 'Magikarp Song', 'Magikarp', 'Comedy', 'Funny', 'Happy', 'Upbeat', 'Reggae', 'Orchestral Cover']",String Player Gamer,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LDVJWG0ZWw4/default.jpg,3.799999952316284,"[('/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio', 0.7699999809265137)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7699999809265137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7699999809265137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

HEwjqgLvxw4,Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence [viola cover],"Join me on Facebook!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/xclassicalcatx\n\nFollow me on Instagram: @yj.chingu\n\nHey everyone!\nHappy new year :) This is my first video for this year, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence. I actually first heard this song in 2011, because my friend Daniel showed it to me. I’d forgotten about it ever since, but I was reminded of it again when I was in Korea last month. I went to a nice little cafe that served traditional tea, and they had a piano version of this song playing. I’m really glad they played the song because that’s what caused me to make this cover. :) I incorporated a piano/string backtrack to accompany my playing.\n\nI originally wanted to upload this on Christmas, but I couldn’t finish it on time… But regardless, I hope you enjoy it. :) It’s a very emotional and heartfelt song filled with a lot of beautiful melodies. \n\nI’m gradually getting more confident with FL Studio, and I’m making it my goal to be more proficient at it this year. :) Thanks for being patient with me. I have another cover lined up soon from Pokemon. :) Stay tuned!\n\nLet’s have a great year!! \n\nFrom,\nJoanna.","['xclassicalcatx', 'Joanna Lee', 'viola', 'cover', 'music', 'ost', 'Joanna Lee viola', 'Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence', 'Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence viola cover']",xclassicalcatx,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HEwjqgLvxw4/default.jpg,6.900000095367432,"[('/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio', 0.7300000190734863)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7300000190734863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7300000190734863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Everything in Bravely Default is so carefully crafted and perfected, and that's what I really appreciate about it!\n\nThis song is what you hear in the menu theme when you pause. Can you believe it?! Even the music for the (pause) menu is this beautiful.\n\nAlso, a bit of a personal update, but I got engaged during my trip to Korea! :') \n\nHope you all enjoy!

D: I’ve been swamped with work and personal life (and Pokemon Ultra Sun…heh), but I’m excited to finally share this new cover of ‘Yoshi’s Story’ with you all!\n\nI personally love this song because it’s one of my favorite OSTs in Super Smash Bros. Melee (that’s my favorite era of the Super Smash series). It’s such an upbeat and bubbly song that takes me back to my childhood. I hope you like listening to my rendition! I’m also happy that I got to make a comeback with my melodica in this cover. It’s been such a long time! \n\nI’ve slowly been learning the wonders of FL Studio! To be completely honest, I was very overwhelmed (I still am) with the idea of moving over to FL, but I think I’m getting the hang of it. I think that had a lot to do with me not uploading in so long.. ;—; \n\nI’ll be traveling to Korea this week with my boyfriend to visit family and go on vacation. :) \n\nI hope to come back very soon with another cover! I have a couple of songs lined up for my video queue. Thanks for always being patient with me. I’m excited and curious to see what you guys think of this cover! Let me know in the comments down below.\n\nUntil next time,\nJoanna\n\n\n\nIf you’re wondering what the ending song to this video, it is Zorsy and my cover of ‘Crossing Field’ from our anime album, Sonum Armonia.

It's my favorite after Fine. :) This is also my first time using FL Studio for the backtrack, so I apologize if it sounds a bit basic.

I teamed up with Ishter today to bring you guys a viola + piano collaboration of the main theme from FFXV! (Somnus).\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't played the game yet, but I've been watching play-throughs of it, and wow. The game is absolutely stunning in its  visuals and story line.\n\nPlease subscribe to my good friend Ishter!~ Special thanks to him for video editing and for collabing with me ^^ Just like the old days, hehe. \nwww.youtube.com/user/Theishter\n\nI'm so glad that we could share this with you all during the Christmas season! It's a very emotional song, but hopefully it warms up your heart.\n\nI also wanted to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season! ^^\n\nSee you next time,\n\nJoanna.\n\nAlso, fun fact-- this is my first recording using FL Studio! Still trying to figure stuff out on it..Special thanks to TeraCMusic for helping me out with it~\n\n- - - - - \n\nPS: -- Before any of you comment on this, I'll let you know that I am well aware of it! Theishter's piano, I believe, was pitched a bit higher to fit the orchestra/concert A...and I'm pretty sure that during my viola recording sessions, I tried my best to match the sharpness, but it didn't really come out the way I expected it to. :/ It was hard to fix because Ishter had a tight schedule!\n\nI'm very sorry about it. Hopefully it doesn't bother you guys too much. I will definitely try to better myself, in both intonation and other techniques, even before I upload so that it doesn't impede the listening experience.","['xclassicalcatx', 'Joanna Lee', 'viola', 'cover', 'music', 'ost', 'Joanna Lee viola', 'Final Fantasy XV', 'FFVX', 'Final Fantasy XV OST', 'FFVX OST', 'Final Fantasy XV Main Theme', 'Final Fantasy XV Somnus', 'FFXV Somnus', 'Somnus Piano', 'Somnus Viola', 'Final Fantasy Cover']",xclassicalcatx,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qT3MTA5qdvg/default.jpg,4.300000190734863,"[('/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio', 0.8500000238418579)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8500000238418579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8500000238418579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My roommate recently got me into the group, and I'm glad that I started to listen to them more! \n\nMost of you know I'm a hardcore Apink fan (I still am and always will be XD). But Twice is pretty cool too! I guess if I had to choose a bias, it would be Sana~ But seriously o.o They're all so young! Kpop recruits such young people these days... o.O Anyway, I really love their new song, so I decided to play it today for you guys! The MV for it is so adorable *o*. I love how each member has a different character! It got a bit overwhelming because I'm still a fairly new fan of the group, but I really loved the concept. :) \n\nAnyway, hope you guys enjoy listening! It's not a super elaborate or crazy cover or anything...I still think it sounds pretty weird on my viola, but I thought I'd share it regardless to see what you guys think. :P This was a super last-minute, rushed cover.........probably took like an hour to do everything. T^T Maybe I should've approached the song in a different way..? lol.\n\nAlso!

FZGexoUkhOI,"Chrono Trigger: ""Wind Scene"" (viola cover)","Join me on Facebook!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/xclassicalcatx\n\nHiiiii everyone!\n\nLOL I feel so bad for not being active on YouTube lately, but things happened and I really couldn't get anything up :/ Hope you guys still enjoy though! This song has been in my head for the past couple of weeks.\n\nA bit about this particular cover...\n\na) Filmed it with my crappy old phone, so quality isn't too great, but I didn't bring my camera home with me so ;-; Reep.\n\nb) Used my really old viola that I first started playing on, so it looks different from my newer one which is sadly away from me atm!! Also no chin rest so I used a scarf LOL\n\nSorry about the crappy quality!! Hope you guys don't mind...Aside from those two disclaimers, I still hope the cover sounds good~ kek...\n\nOH! And if you guys are going to Anime Expo this year, be sure to stop me and say hi~ I'd love to meet you guys~ ~ This is probably my last year going :( So don't forget!! hehe. \n\nPlease keep up with me throughout the convention by following my Facebook -  https://www.facebook.com/xclassicalcatx/ \n\nI will be cosplaying Judy Hopps from Zootopia~ \n\n==MINI_RANT==\n\nHonestly, I've been talking about this on my streams recently, but I feel like a lot of YouTube these days (especially musicians) have lost touch with the ""magic"" that occurred when they first started out. I feel pretty intimidated by all the YouTube musician stars who seem to prioritize visuals over music, and thus, their content LOOKS a whole lot better...A lot of that requires equipment that can really add up to be a financial burden XD... \n\nI myself didn't start out with the mindset of being ""Internet Famous"" or to get filthy rich off of my covers. I started out because I was bored and I truly enjoyed making music. Regardless of what crappy quality I had to offer to the world. All that fancy stuff didn't matter. I know that a lot of you who have been following me since I first started back in 2011 remember the days where I used to film with my iPhone (audio AND video) and just straight up uploaded the best take. XD I am honest when I say that I miss those days. It was really a lot more fun. No unnecessary stress on how perfect my videos are, how many elaborate camera angles I used, or how much money I'd make off of a viral video. None of that mattered. It was just me, my viola, and my old iPhone, and that's how I was able to connect with people through my love for music.\n\nSorry for the rant! Maybe I'm the only one who really feels that way. I just wanted to voice my thoughts on the YouTube music community. Particularly because making this video without my usual resources reminded me of why I do YouTube. I don't need fancy stuff, and though sometimes I'm tempted to go crazy and hire my friends to help me make beautiful MVs, that shouldn't come before my affinity for making quality, intimate recordings. I'm not saying that you shouldn't take advantage of the great equipment that exists to help make your music videos shine. It's just that I really value how I started out, and I wish that people wouldn't forget their roots and why they started YouTube in the first place...unless it was to make money and get big. Lol. Then in that case, it's fine I guess XD...\n\n==THANKS_FOR_READING==\n\nAnyway!!\n\nPiano is by: Piano Perspectives! Please go subscribe to him~\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPb1AmGQzrw\n\nHave a great day guys!! Hope to see some of you at AX2016 :) Thanks again for supporting me even when my uploads aren't perfect or consistent.

yy7vx1nniRc,Pokémon DPPT: Snowpoint City [ ❄ viola cover ❄ ],"Merry Christmas everyone!! Happy birthday Jesus! :D \n\nI originally wanted to cover something more epic, but hopefully this is okay for Christmas. It took me quite a while to arrange this because this piece has some WEIRD accidentals. It's definitely not the best cover of Snowpoint City on the internet...XD But I was short on time, and I tried!! Hehe. Soz.\n\nAnyway, although I don't particularly consider Sinnoh my favorite, it's still a great generation in terms of its soundtrack!! Plus Candice is a cutie! Can't argue with that. :D\n\nI know that a lot of my viewers aren't Christian, but I wanted to take this time to talk about Christmas and how important it is to me, especially being a believer. I think it's essential to give thanks and focus on what really matters, and that's the birth of Jesus Christ. At this exact time last year, I was in a really bad place in my life, extremely lost and hopeless, as you can probably see in my videos from then. You probably can't tell what I was feeling because most of the time, I'm smiling in my covers, but I was really, really torn up inside. One of my viewers asked about this because he could tell from a particular video that I was really hurt and depressed  (thank you again for your care, if you're reading this, it was touching that you noticed). I was hopeless until I went back to God again. I'm much better now, and very happy! So I wanted to really thank Him for always being my cornerstone, my Lord, my friend, and my Savior. This is why Christmas is a really meaningful day. Let's remember Him in all things we do. :)\n\nThank you for reading, especially if you got this far in the description box. I know lots of people just disregard the description box because it's a whole wall of text, but whether you're a nonbeliever or a Christian, it warms my heart to know that I can share my thoughts with you! \n\nI do want to cover some of my favorite worship music in the future, so I can share with you guys some of the songs that touch my heart. (songs from Chris Tomlin/Hillsong United/Casting Crowns/Matt Redman/Phil Wickham/etc!)\n\nOh, also I have some kpop covers coming up as well! Things from Ailee, Apink, etc. Also!! Maybe something from Star Wars...cuz I really loved the movie XD... or something from the Prince of Egypt cuz I just saw that too...LOL, so many ideas!! And oh!....a special -Neko- related surprise collab with Mr. Parecki that I shall not spoil as of yet. ;) \n\nPlease stay warm and healthy over this winter! Have a great rest of 2015 ^^. I wanted to also thank you guys for always staying by  my side! My channel started really randomly and humbly, and I still think it's very small, but it holds a really big place in my heart because I always dreamt of being able to share my love of music with people across the world! You guys give me hope.\n\nHope you enjoy this cover even though it's short and really simple!! It brought back memories when I was making it. :D\n\nHappy holidays,\n\nJoanna\n\nJoin me on Facebook!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/xclassicalcatx","['xclassicalcatx', 'Joanna Lee', 'viola', 'cover', 'music', 'ost', 'Joanna Lee viola', 'snowpoint city', 'snowpoint', 'snowpoint city music', 'pokemon', 'pokemon dppt', 'pokemon ost', 'snowpoint city viola', 'snowpoint viola', 'snowpoint violin', 'pokemon diamond', 'pokemon pearl', 'pokemon platinum', 'pokemon dppt ost', 'pokemon dppt music']",xclassicalcatx,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yy7vx1nniRc/default.jpg,17.0,"[('/People & Society/Religion & Belief', 0.9800000190734863), ('/Hobbies & Leisure/Special Occasions/Holidays & Seasonal Events', 0.9200000166893005), ('/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio/Religious Music', 0.5600000023841858)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5600000023841858,0.0,0.5600000023841858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5600000023841858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9200000166893005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9800000190734863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9200000166893005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Check out their black hole course at http://brilliant.org/minutephysicsblackhole\n\nSupport MinutePhysics on Patreon! http://www.patreon.com/minutephysics\nLink to Patreon Supporters: http://www.minutephysics.com/supporters/\n\nThis video is about how efficient various reactions are at converting mass to energy (as we know from the Einstein mass-energy equivalence of E=mc^2). Antimatter is very efficient but it is not naturally-occurring. Chemical reactions like fire or explosions are very inefficient. Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are better, but not amazing on an absolute scale. Non-rotating black holes (Schwarzschild) and rotating (Kerr) are by far the most efficient, due to their accretion disks and very small radius of their innermost stable circular orbits.   \n\nREFERENCES:\nPeriodic Videos Hydrogen Explosion in slow motion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTgeeTB_kA\n\nCIA World Factbook Norway Energy Consumption: https://web.archive.org/web/20120128032332/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2042rank.html\n\nBinding Energy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy\n\nHydrogen molecular bonding: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-73-introductory-quantum-mechanics-i-fall-2005/lecture-notes/sec13.pdf\n\nGibbs free energy of water formation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Gibbs_free_energy_of_formation\n\nParty Balloon Size Chart: https://broadwaypartyrental.com/wp-content/uploads/HELIUM-BALOON-CHART.pdf\n\nMass Excess https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_excess\n\nTable of Mass Excesses: http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/masses/mass.mas12\n\nDeuterium-Tritium Hydrogen Fusion Energy Released: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=((deuterium+atomic+mass)%2B(tritium+atomic+mass)-(helium-4+atomic+mass)-(neutron+mass))%2F((deuterium+atomic+mass)%2B(tritium+atomic+mass))\n\nHydrogen to Helium Fusion chain efficiency: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(4(proton+mass)-(helium+4+atomic+mass))%2F(4(proton+mass))\n\nUranium-235 fission efficiency: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(neutron+mass%2B(uranium+235+atomic+mass)-(krypton+92+atomic+mass)-(barium+141+atomic+mass)-3(neutron+mass))%2F(neutron+mass%2B(uranium+235+atomic+mass))\n\nBlack Hole Accretion rates: http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~garret/teaching/lecture7-2012.pdf\n\n\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd Google+ (does anyone use this any more?) - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich","['physics', 'minutephysics', 'science']",minutephysics,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t-O-Qdh7VvQ/default.jpg,3.5,"[('/Science', 0.7099999785423279)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7099999785423279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This video is an explanation of how time travel functions in different popular movies, books, & shows – not how it works “under the hood"", but how it causally affects the perspective of characters’ timelines (who has free will? can you change things by going back to the past or forwards into the future?).

Even though Albert Einstein (together with collaborators in the EPR Paradox paper) wanted to show that quantum mechanics must be incomplete because it was nonlocal (he didn't like ""spooky action at a distance""), John Bell managed to prove that any local real hidden variable theory would have to satisfy certain simple statistical properties that quantum mechanical experiments (and the theory that describes them) violate. Since then, GHZ and others have managed to extend the theoretical work, and Alain Aspect performed the first Bell test experiment in the late 1980s.\n\nThanks to Vince Rubinetti for the music: https://soundcloud.com/vincerubinetti/one-two-zeta\n\nAnd thanks to Evan Miyazono, Aatish Bhatia, and Jasper Palfree for discussions and camaraderie during some of the inception of this video.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nJohn Bell's Original Paper: http://inspirehep.net/record/31657/files/vol1p195-200_001.pdf\n\nQuantum Theory and Reality: https://www.scientificamerican.com/media/pdf/197911_0158.pdf\n\n""What Bell Did"" By Tim Maudlin: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.1826\n\nBell's Theorem on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem\n\n2015 experimental confirmation that QM violates Bell's theorem: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.05949.pdf\nhttps://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.250402\n\nBell's Theorem without Inequalities (GHZ): http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.16243\n\nKochen-Specker Theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochen–Specker_theorem\n\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd Google+ (does anyone use this any more?) - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich","['physics', 'minutephysics', 'science']",minutephysics,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zcqZHYo7ONs/default.jpg,1.7000000476837158,"[('/Science', 0.699999988079071)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.699999988079071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

h2nqgKL2JQU,Why It's HARD To Land on Mars,"Support MinutePhysics on Patreon! http://www.patreon.com/minutephysics\n\nThis video is about why it's harder to successfully land spacecraft and landers and rovers on Mars than on Earth, or Venus, or the Moon, or Titan, or asteroids. It all comes down to atmospheric density! When there's no atmosphere, you can do a powered descent in a flimsy tinfoil spacecraft like the Lunar Module, and when there's plenty of atmosphere you can do an unpowered descent via heat shield and parachutes like the space shuttle, Apollo command module, Soyuz, Huygens, etc. But on Mars with its thin air, you have to do both powered & unpowered descent, getting the worst of both worlds.\n\nThanks to Hoppy Price from JPL for fact-checking this video!\n\nLink to Patreon Supporters: http://www.minutephysics.com/supporters/\n\nREFERENCES\nSpreadsheet to calculate landing success rates: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jqeZCG56UBKvd\_wsyW3GD-qd9TAsaW1RPAiZ-1BCUaE/edit?usp=sharing\n\nNASA Low Density Supersonic Decelerator Fact Sheets: https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/737628main\_Final\_LDSD\_Fact\_Sheet\_3-26-13.pdf\nhttps://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press\_kits/ldsd.pdf\n\nLDSD Test Footage: https://www.nasa.gov/mission\_pages/tdm/ldsd/videos.html\n\nMore LDSD Test Footage:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJzeeYoLn50\n\nList of Missions to Mars: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_missions\_to\_Mars\n\nList of Missions to the Moon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_missions\_to\_the\_Moon\n\nList of Missions to Saturn: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration\_of\_Saturn\n\nList of Missions to Venus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_missions\_to\_Venus\n\nCuriosity Rover Landing Overview: https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/insituexploration/edl/\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd Google+ (does anyone use this any more?) - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich","['physics', 'minutephysics', 'science', 'NASA', 'Jet Propulsion Laboratory', 'Caltech']",minutephysics,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h2nqgKL2JQU/default.jpg,1.100000023841858,"[('/Science/Astronomy', 0.5600000023841858), ('/Science/Engineering & Technology', 0.5099999904632568)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5099999904632568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5099999904632568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5600000023841858,0.0,0.0,0.0

FO_Ox_dH0M8,How Zero-G Planes Work,"The European Space Agency offered me a seat on their zero-g plane: it's an Airbus A310 that flies parabolic maneuvers, pulling up into the sky and then arcing back down, giving its passengers about 20 seconds of weightlessness (or ""microgravity"") at a time. Here's how it works.\n\nSome people would have filmed their script on the ground, and just messed about while floating. I decided to go for something a bit more challenging.\n\n**\n\nIf you're a masters or PhD student from an ESA member state, and zero-g sounds like your thing, have a look at the Fly Your Thesis program: http://www.esa.int/Education/Fly_Your_Thesis -- the 2017-18 submissions are closed, but that just gives you time to start planning for next year...\n\n**\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhy isn't Neil floating around the cabin in zero-g?: Sometimes, his feet are under a safety strap, so he doesn't drift away. Sometimes, he's holding on with one hand, and he's just that good at zero-g maneuvers.\n\nWhy's my face so red?: During the 1.8g phase, my heart has to work extra hard to pump blood up to my head -- when I switch to 0g, it takes a few seconds for it to slow pumping, so my blood pressure spikes.\n\nWhat stabilised camera did I use?: You're looking at footage from a GoPro Fusion, stabilised in post using Adobe After Effects and the telemetry from the plane's sensors.\n\nWhat did it feel like?: There'll be a behind-the-scenes video on the Matt and Tom channel on Saturday, hopefully!\n\n**\n\nCamera: Melanie Cowan\n\nThank you to everyone at ESA and Novespace who helped make this happen!\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo","['tom scott', 'tomscott', 'built for science', 'zero-g', 'zero g', 'zero gravity', 'weightlessness', 'zero g plane', 'zero-g plane', 'zero g flight', 'zero-g flight', 'microgravity', 'ESA', 'european space agency', 'fly your thesis', 'F-WNOV', 'novespace', 'parabola', 'parabolic flight']",Tom Scott,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FO_Ox_dH0M8/default.jpg,1.2999999523162842,"[('/Business & Industrial/Aerospace & Defense/Space Technology', 0.6399999856948853), ('/Science/Engineering & Technology', 0.5799999833106995)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5799999833106995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5799999833106995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6399999856948853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6399999856948853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

6Qu9KnohYG0,What Are Brain Waves?,"This video was sponsored by ""Robot-Proof"", written by Northeastern University's President, Joseph E. Aoun. Learn more here: https://goo.gl/uF5Kx8\n\nThank you to our supporters on https://www.patreon.com/MinuteEarth\n\nEven the parts of our brains that don't control physical movement show a lot of rhythm, and that might be integral to how our brains work.\n___________________________________________\n\nTo learn more, start your googling with these keywords: \n\nneural oscillation: better known as a ""brainwave,"" a neural oscillation is repetitive, often rhythmic activity in the central nervous system. neurons can sync up with the help of pacemaker cells or structure, or through entrainment. \n\nentrainment: the ability of tons and tons of neurons to quickly sync up is due to something called entrainment – here's a cool demo of essentially how that works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl2aYFv_978\n\ncentral pattern generator: neural networks that produce rhythmic, patterned electrical outputs. CPGs are usually relatively simple neural circuits and are responsible for virtually all the rhythmic motions you see in nature, from jellyfish swimming to human breathing. while we often think of our brains as reaction machines – like, we touch something hot and quickly pull away – central pattern generators don't need any stimulus to work. you can pull them out of an animal and put them in a petri dish and the neurons will still fire with the same rhythms. \n\nfeature binding: when you see your cat and you know right away it's your cat...well, somehow, your brain is putting together all kinds of information about the object's shape, size, color, motion, position in your field of vision, and lots of other contextual clues to make that happen. neuroscientists call this ""feature binding,"" and neural oscillations may be key to pulling it off. \n\n_________________________________________\n\nSubscribe to MinuteEarth on YouTube: http://goo.gl/EpIDGd\nSupport us on Patreon: https://goo.gl/ZVgLQZ\nAnd visit our website: https://www.minuteearth.com/\n\nSay hello on Facebook: http://goo.gl/FpAvo6\nAnd Twitter: http://goo.gl/Y1aWVC\n\nAnd download our videos on itunes:  https://goo.gl/sfwS6n\n___________________________________________\n\nCredits (and Twitter handles):\nScript Writer: Emily Elert (@eelert)\nScript Editor: Kate Yoshida (@KateYoshida)\nVideo Illustrator: Ever Salazar (@eversalazar)\nVideo Director: Emily Elert (@eelert)\nVideo Narrator: Kate Yoshida (@KateYoshida)\nWith Contributions From: Henry Reich, Alex Reich, Peter Reich, David Goldenberg \nMusic by: Nathaniel Schroeder: http://www.soundcloud.com/drschroeder\n\nImage Credits: \n\nSnake Crawling - BigfootHD\nhttps://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-2582720-stock-footage-snake-crawling.html\n\nGreyhound running - Objectivity\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq_Oj6qzeIU\n\nHummingbird - Smarter Every Day\nhttps://youtu.be/1VA8v1btKdQ?t=73\n\n___________________________________________\n\nReferences:\n\nBuzsaki, G.

The tailgate ran throughout the day as a sort of base camp for homecoming sports events and other activities: Oswego men’s soccer tallied a nailbiter loss by one goal late in the game against Geneseo; club baseball, club rugby and others played at fields around campus as part of the Homecoming games; and a Pumpkin Run and Walk for both students and alumni to race - or meander - around campus benefitted the Blessings in a Backpack program, which provides food on the weekends for elementary school children in the Oswego area who might otherwise go hungry. There was also a reception for President’s Circle and Sheldon Legacy Society donors, a Scholars Breakfast and a happy hour for Graduates Of The Last Decade.

JkP8SmFHIqM,Tips for attending an admissions open house,"Coming to Oswego for an admissions open house? Admissions student ambassador Kenny Belvin has some tips to make the most of it.\n\nKrystal Cole, a student reporter for SUNY Oswego News and an admissions intern, asked Kenny Belvin, an intern for admissions open houses, for tips prospective students and families can use if they come to fall open houses -- like the ones the college will offer on Oct. 28 and Nov. 10.\n\nKrystal: ""I'm Krystal and this is Kenny and today we're gonna talk to you about what you should do when you come to visit for an open house.""\n\nKenny: ""Let's get started.\n\n""Open houses tend to be a bit more crazy than normal college visits, but the most important thing to do is bring an open mind and a positive mindset. Check in for our open houses starts at 10 a.m., so try and arrive at 10 and stay for the whole day if you can. The longer you stay, the more information you can get out of your visit.\n\n""Another tip is to take advantage of our tour guides. We have just about 30 of them and they love Oswego and they want to tell you why they love it. Try and talk to as many of us as you can. We all know the facts, but we all have a unique perspective on Oswego that we would love to share with you.\n\n""The next tip is don't leave any questions unanswered. If you come to Oswego with 10 questions, make sure you get all 10 of them answered.\n\n""Even you've already taken a tour of Oswego, make sure you take another one when you come to an open house. Every tour is a different experience.""\n\nKrystal: ""To book your admissions experience today, go online to http://oswego.edu/visit. We'll see you on campus.""","['college search', 'choosing a college', 'attending an admissions open house', 'attending a college open house', 'how to choose a college', 'suny oswego', 'oswego state', 'state university of new york at oswego', 'college admissions']",sunyoswegovideo,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JkP8SmFHIqM/default.jpg,2.0999999046325684,"[('/Jobs & Education/Education/Colleges & Universities', 0.8399999737739563)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8399999737739563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8399999737739563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
