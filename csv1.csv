While I definitely don't intend on making this kind of video a regular presence on the channel, in this very special instance I felt so strongly about the issue that I wanted to say something on a personal note. Thanks for all your support and for checking out this very special video from me, and as always, thanks for watching!\n\nYou've no doubt heard the story over the last week. Viner turned social media star Logan Paul uploaded an exploitative and disrespectful video. A LOT has already been said about that. Instead, I'm here today to comment on YouTube's response. A week after the video, YouTube released an open letter saying that it will take steps to address the situation, but as we all know, they sometimes OVERCORRECT in times like this.

Different lists use different minimums for matches, innings, or runs scored to weed out freakish cases.\n\n** Comparing athletes, especially across sports, is notoriously difficult and more of a conversation starter than exact science. An interesting article here: https://www.statslife.org.uk/sports/1989-did-don-bradman-s-cricketing-genius-make-him-a-statistical-outlier\n\n*** A lower ""not out"" score in Bradman's next innings would also have made a 100+ average possible, but that's a very unlikely scenario in the ""first innings"" of a match.

Some people suggest they may be a better fit on Brady's dedicated physics channel (called Sixty Symbols).\n\nIn response, the reasons they are on Numberphile are:\n\n1) Tadashi, while certainly a modern polymath, is based in a mathematics department.\n2) This sub series (with its animation and extra production work) has been supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, a Numberphile collaborator.\n3) Some of the previous and future Tadashi videos are more math-oriented than physics - and it just makes sense to put them on one channel rather than dividing the series between two channels on an ad hoc basis.\n\nIn a multi-disciplinary world, it is challenging to run YouTube channels which people come to associate with just one discipline.\n\nThat said, feel free to go over and watch hundreds of physics videos on Sixty Symbols --- https://www.youtube.com/sixtysymbols","['numberphile', 'kamifusen', 'paper balloon']",Numberphile,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/un-pTKfC1dQ/default.jpg,0.5,"[('/Arts & Entertainment', 0.6299999952316284), ('/Science', 0.5699999928474426)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6299999952316284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5699999928474426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I actually first heard this song in 2011, because my friend Daniel showed it to me. I’d forgotten about it ever since, but I was reminded of it again when I was in Korea last month. I went to a nice little cafe that served traditional tea, and they had a piano version of this song playing. I’m really glad they played the song because that’s what caused me to make this cover. :) I incorporated a piano/string backtrack to accompany my playing.\n\nI originally wanted to upload this on Christmas, but I couldn’t finish it on time… But regardless, I hope you enjoy it. :) It’s a very emotional and heartfelt song filled with a lot of beautiful melodies. \n\nI’m gradually getting more confident with FL Studio, and I’m making it my goal to be more proficient at it this year. :) Thanks for being patient with me. I have another cover lined up soon from Pokemon. :) Stay tuned!\n\nLet’s have a great year!! \n\nFrom,\nJoanna.","['xclassicalcatx', 'Joanna Lee', 'viola', 'cover', 'music', 'ost', 'Joanna Lee viola', 'Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence', 'Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence viola cover']",xclassicalcatx,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HEwjqgLvxw4/default.jpg,6.900000095367432,"[('/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio', 0.7300000190734863)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7300000190734863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7300000190734863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'd been meaning to cover it for so long! lol. It's been a while since I've played the game, but I love the music so much! I also have the tendency of grinding like CRAZY in those types of games, so it was definitely one of my favorites haha. Everything in Bravely Default is so carefully crafted and perfected, and that's what I really appreciate about it!\n\nThis song is what you hear in the menu theme when you pause. Can you believe it?! Even the music for the (pause) menu is this beautiful.\n\nAlso, a bit of a personal update, but I got engaged during my trip to Korea! :') \n\nHope you all enjoy! I'm trying to squeeze in a Christmas cover, but I have no idea if I'll be able to.. lol!\n\nSee you next time. :)\n\n-Joanna","['xclassicalcatx', 'Joanna Lee', 'viola', 'cover', 'music', 'ost', 'Joanna Lee viola', 'Bravely Default', 'Bravely Default menu theme', ""Eternity's Moment"", ""Eternity's Moment Bravely Default"", 'Bravely Default OST', ""Eternity's Moment viola cover"", 'Bravely Default viola cover']",xclassicalcatx,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WO613wXDfAo/default.jpg,3.4000000953674316,"[('/Games', 0.6800000071525574), ('/Arts & Entertainment', 0.5)]",0.0,0.0,0.6800000071525574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

D: I’ve been swamped with work and personal life (and Pokemon Ultra Sun…heh), but I’m excited to finally share this new cover of ‘Yoshi’s Story’ with you all!\n\nI personally love this song because it’s one of my favorite OSTs in Super Smash Bros. Melee (that’s my favorite era of the Super Smash series). It’s such an upbeat and bubbly song that takes me back to my childhood. I hope you like listening to my rendition! I’m also happy that I got to make a comeback with my melodica in this cover. It’s been such a long time! \n\nI’ve slowly been learning the wonders of FL Studio! To be completely honest, I was very overwhelmed (I still am) with the idea of moving over to FL, but I think I’m getting the hang of it. I think that had a lot to do with me not uploading in so long.. ;—; \n\nI’ll be traveling to Korea this week with my boyfriend to visit family and go on vacation. :) \n\nI hope to come back very soon with another cover! I have a couple of songs lined up for my video queue. Thanks for always being patient with me. I’m excited and curious to see what you guys think of this cover! Let me know in the comments down below.\n\nUntil next time,\nJoanna\n\n\n\nIf you’re wondering what the ending song to this video, it is Zorsy and my cover of ‘Crossing Field’ from our anime album, Sonum Armonia.

I teamed up with Ishter today to bring you guys a viola + piano collaboration of the main theme from FFXV! (Somnus).\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't played the game yet, but I've been watching play-throughs of it, and wow. The game is absolutely stunning in its  visuals and story line.\n\nPlease subscribe to my good friend Ishter!~ Special thanks to him for video editing and for collabing with me ^^ Just like the old days, hehe. \nwww.youtube.com/user/Theishter\n\nI'm so glad that we could share this with you all during the Christmas season! It's a very emotional song, but hopefully it warms up your heart.\n\nI also wanted to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season! ^^\n\nSee you next time,\n\nJoanna.\n\nAlso, fun fact-- this is my first recording using FL Studio! Still trying to figure stuff out on it..Special thanks to TeraCMusic for helping me out with it~\n\n- - - - - \n\nPS: -- Before any of you comment on this, I'll let you know that I am well aware of it! Theishter's piano, I believe, was pitched a bit higher to fit the orchestra/concert A...and I'm pretty sure that during my viola recording sessions, I tried my best to match the sharpness, but it didn't really come out the way I expected it to. :/ It was hard to fix because Ishter had a tight schedule!\n\nI'm very sorry about it. Hopefully it doesn't bother you guys too much. I will definitely try to better myself, in both intonation and other techniques, even before I upload so that it doesn't impede the listening experience.","['xclassicalcatx', 'Joanna Lee', 'viola', 'cover', 'music', 'ost', 'Joanna Lee viola', 'Final Fantasy XV', 'FFVX', 'Final Fantasy XV OST', 'FFVX OST', 'Final Fantasy XV Main Theme', 'Final Fantasy XV Somnus', 'FFXV Somnus', 'Somnus Piano', 'Somnus Viola', 'Final Fantasy Cover']",xclassicalcatx,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qT3MTA5qdvg/default.jpg,4.300000190734863,"[('/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio', 0.8500000238418579)]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8500000238418579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8500000238418579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My roommate recently got me into the group, and I'm glad that I started to listen to them more! \n\nMost of you know I'm a hardcore Apink fan (I still am and always will be XD). But Twice is pretty cool too! I guess if I had to choose a bias, it would be Sana~ But seriously o.o They're all so young! Kpop recruits such young people these days... o.O Anyway, I really love their new song, so I decided to play it today for you guys! The MV for it is so adorable *o*. I love how each member has a different character! It got a bit overwhelming because I'm still a fairly new fan of the group, but I really loved the concept. :) \n\nAnyway, hope you guys enjoy listening! It's not a super elaborate or crazy cover or anything...I still think it sounds pretty weird on my viola, but I thought I'd share it regardless to see what you guys think. :P This was a super last-minute, rushed cover.........probably took like an hour to do everything.

This song has been in my head for the past couple of weeks.\n\nA bit about this particular cover...\n\na) Filmed it with my crappy old phone, so quality isn't too great, but I didn't bring my camera home with me so ;-; Reep.\n\nb) Used my really old viola that I first started playing on, so it looks different from my newer one which is sadly away from me atm!! Also no chin rest so I used a scarf LOL\n\nSorry about the crappy quality!! Hope you guys don't mind...Aside from those two disclaimers, I still hope the cover sounds good~ kek...\n\nOH! And if you guys are going to Anime Expo this year, be sure to stop me and say hi~ I'd love to meet you guys~ ~ This is probably my last year going :( So don't forget!! hehe. \n\nPlease keep up with me throughout the convention by following my Facebook -  https://www.facebook.com/xclassicalcatx/ \n\nI will be cosplaying Judy Hopps from Zootopia~ \n\n==MINI_RANT==\n\nHonestly, I've been talking about this on my streams recently, but I feel like a lot of YouTube these days (especially musicians) have lost touch with the ""magic"" that occurred when they first started out. I feel pretty intimidated by all the YouTube musician stars who seem to prioritize visuals over music, and thus, their content LOOKS a whole lot better...A lot of that requires equipment that can really add up to be a financial burden XD... \n\nI myself didn't start out with the mindset of being ""Internet Famous"" or to get filthy rich off of my covers. I started out because I was bored and I truly enjoyed making music. Regardless of what crappy quality I had to offer to the world. All that fancy stuff didn't matter. I know that a lot of you who have been following me since I first started back in 2011 remember the days where I used to film with my iPhone (audio AND video) and just straight up uploaded the best take. XD I am honest when I say that I miss those days. It was really a lot more fun. No unnecessary stress on how perfect my videos are, how many elaborate camera angles I used, or how much money I'd make off of a viral video. None of that mattered. It was just me, my viola, and my old iPhone, and that's how I was able to connect with people through my love for music.\n\nSorry for the rant! Maybe I'm the only one who really feels that way. I just wanted to voice my thoughts on the YouTube music community. Particularly because making this video without my usual resources reminded me of why I do YouTube. I don't need fancy stuff, and though sometimes I'm tempted to go crazy and hire my friends to help me make beautiful MVs, that shouldn't come before my affinity for making quality, intimate recordings. I'm not saying that you shouldn't take advantage of the great equipment that exists to help make your music videos shine. It's just that I really value how I started out, and I wish that people wouldn't forget their roots and why they started YouTube in the first place...unless it was to make money and get big. Lol. Then in that case, it's fine I guess XD...\n\n==THANKS_FOR_READING==\n\nAnyway!!\n\nPiano is by: Piano Perspectives! Please go subscribe to him~\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPb1AmGQzrw\n\nHave a great day guys!!
